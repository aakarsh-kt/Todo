This is a Todo application build in React.

In this web app you can add your tasks and arrange them according to their priority.
You can also mark a task as done or delete if you are not in the mood of doing it :)

It uses your local storage to save your data.

You can access the web app at [ToDo](https://toodooes.netlify.app/).
